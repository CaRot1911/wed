<h1>Basic Usage<a class="headerlink" href="#basic-usage" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Wed is a web-based editor that assists users in editing XML documents
according to their own Relax NG schema. It runs in a web browser. It
is alpha software. We aim to make it extensible, but the API is likely
to change until we hit version 1.0.0.</p>
<p>Known limitations:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Wed currently does understand a large subset of Relax NG, but some
constructs are not supported. See the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mangalam-research/salve/">salve</a> package for details.</li>
<li>Wed does not currently support ordering attributes according to some
preference. (The order is whatever the DOM implementation does by
default.)</li>
<li>Wed does not currently support multiline values in attributes.</li>
<li>Empty elements appear in the editor as if they had an opening and
closing tag, irrespective of how they are encoded in the original
document. So <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;foo/&gt;</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;foo&gt;&lt;/foo&gt;</span></tt> are treated the
same. Part of this problem is due to the fact that wed sees the
document as a DOM tree, not as a serialization. In a DOM tree,
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;foo/&gt;</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;foo&gt;&lt;/foo&gt;</span></tt> are the same.</li>
<li>Elements that <em>cannot</em> contain anything appear in the editor as if
they <em>could</em>. The validator raises an error if these elements are
filled with any contents but it would be nicer if they were
displayed in a way that distinguished them from the elements that
<em>can</em> be filled with contents. We worked on a prototype that would
check whether an element <em>can</em> contain anything and display it
differently if it could not. However, this required that the
rendering engine query the validating engine during rendering, which
made rendering extremely slow. Since the editor will raise an error
if an element that should be empty is filled erroneously, we&#8217;ve
decided that a solution to this problem can wait.</li>
<li>Eventually the plan is to handle XML namespace changes completely,
and there is incipient code to deal with this; for now the safe
thing to do if you have a file using multiple namespaces is to
declare them once and for all on the top element, and never change
them throughout the document. Otherwise, problems are likely.</li>
<li>We&#8217;ve not tested a setup in which more than one wed instance appears
on the same page.</li>
<li>Keyboard navigation in contextual menus works. However, if the mouse
is hovering over menu items, two items will be highlighted at once,
which may be confusing. This seems to be a limitation of CSS which
Bootstrap does nothing to deal with. (One element may be in the
focused state (keyboard) while another is in the hover state.)</li>
<li>Wed does not work with RTL scripts. There no inherent reason wed
could not support them but the project for which it is developed
currently does not need support for RTL scripts. So no resources
have been expended towards supporting this.</li>
<li>Wed is not internationalized. Although the contents of a document
could be in any language, wed&#8217;s UI is in English. Again, there is no
inherent reason wed could not support other languages for the
UI. The project for which it is developed currently does not need
support for other languages, hence this state of affairs.</li>

</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="browser-requirements">
<h1>Browser Requirements<a class="headerlink" href="#browser-requirements" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Wed is primarily developed using a recent version of Chrome (version
36; versions 26-35 have also been used earlier) and a recent version
of Firefox (version 28; versions 20-27 have also been used earlier)
for testing. (But see a note about Chrome 34 below.) The fact that wed
is developed using these browsers influences the severity and
frequency of bugs you can expect to run into.</p>
<p>Here is the list of officially supported browsers, in order of
decreasing priority:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Chrome 36 and higher and Firefox 28 and higher, about equally.</li>
<li>IE 10 and 11, about equally.</li>
</ul>
<p>File an issue on github if you find a problem with one of the
supported browsers above.</p>
<p>We would like to support phone and tablet browsers but due to a lack
of development resources, such support is unlikely to materialize
soon. In decreasing order of likelihood, the following cases are
unlikely to ever be supported:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Chrome 34: the luminaries at Google decided to remove
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Attr.ownerElement</span></tt> from Chrome 34. It was reintroduced in
Chrome 35.</li>
<li>IE 9. We&#8217;d need a) a substantial demand for it and b) people willing
to participate in providing support.</li>
<li>Versions of Chrome and Firefox older than those mentioned above.</li>
<li>IE 8 and earlier.</li>
<li>Antique browsers.</li>
<li>Oddball browsers or other software or hardware systems that present
web pages. (E.g. gaming consoles, smart TVs.)</li>
<li>Operating systems or browsers no longer supported by their own
vendors.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="os-x">
<h2>OS X<a class="headerlink" href="#os-x" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The test suite depends on native events to do its work, but support
for native events in OS X is spotty:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Chrome: it is possible to generate <em>some</em> native events.</li>
<li>Firefox reports that it does not support native events at all.</li>
<li>Safari does not support native events at all.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your best bet in OS X is to use Chrome because we can&#8217;t run the test
suite with Firefox or Safari.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="safari">
<h2>Safari<a class="headerlink" href="#safari" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Safari is a vexing case. Wed may or may not work on Safari. We
currently cannot run the automated test suite with Safari. Manual
testing is out of the question.</p>
<p>We would like to have wed be supported on recent versions of Safari to
the same extent it is supported on recent versions of Chrome, Firefox
and IE. The tool we use to test it is Selenium. For better or for
worse this is the go-to tool to do the kind of test wed
needs. Selenium&#8217;s support for Chrome and Firefox benefits from
collaboration from developers who are responsible for developing these
two browsers. In the case of IE, it appears (from reading bug reports)
that Microsoft is communicating with the Selenium developers to
resolve issues. However, we&#8217;ve not seen evidence of any collaboration
between the Selenium project and Apple. Thus testing support for
Safari is deficient, and it is not something that we here have the
resources to fix.</p>
<p>If you desire that wed be actually tested on Safari and are in a
position to contribute substantial monetary or technical resources
towards this goal, you are welcome to contact us. In particular,
immediate problem we&#8217;ve run into when trying to test on Safari is this
[Selenium
issue](<a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=4136">http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=4136</a>). If
you want fix it, then this would bring us one step closer to being
able to test wed on Safari. And regarding the state of Selenium
support for Safari, take note this response from a Selenium project
member:</p>
<p>&gt; Safari is not a priority, sorry. But your patches are welcome!</p>
<p>Absent these patches, wed is unlikely to support Safari.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you feel the urge to write an email saying &#8220;You
should just...&#8221;, then please abstain because there is nothing &#8220;just&#8221;
about testing web applications.</p>

<div class="section" id="dependencies">
<h1>Dependencies<a class="headerlink" href="#dependencies" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Wed is packaged as a RequireJS module. To use it in a browser
environment, you need to first load RequireJS and pass to it a
configuration that will allow it to find wed&#8217;s code. An example of
such configuration, which allows running the browser-dependent test
suite, is located in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mangalam-research/wed/blob/master/config/requirejs-config-dev.js">config/requirejs-config-dev.js</a>.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="first admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p class="last">If you want to change this configuration for
experimentation or to match your local setup, please copy
it to the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">local_config</span></tt> directory and edit it
<em>there</em>. This directory is not tracked by git. This is
true of all files that are stored in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mangalam-research/wed/blob/master/config/">config/</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>Please see the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mangalam-research/wed/blob/master/package.json">package.json</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mangalam-research/wed/blob/master/config/requirejs-config-dev.js">config/requirejs-config-dev.js</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mangalam-research/wed/blob/master/Makefile">Makefile</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mangalam-research/wed/blob/master/build.mk">build.mk</a> files for details regarding run-time and
development dependencies. Running the test suite also requires that
<a class="reference external" href="http://saxon.sourceforge.net/">saxon</a> be installed.</p>
<p>Building wed&#8217;s documentation <strong>additionally</strong> requires the following
packages:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>jsdoc3</li>
<li>rst2html</li>
<li>perl (a stop-gap measure which we plan to get rid of eventually)</li>
</ul>
<p>Running wed&#8217;s selenium-based tests <strong>additionally</strong> requires the
following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Python 2.7.</li>
<li>Python&#8217;s Selenium package.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://github.com/mangalam-research/selenic">selenic</a></li>
<li>behave (the python package)</li>
<li>nginx is highly recommended but optional.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to contribute to wed, your code will have to pass the
checks listed in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mangalam-research/wed/blob/master/.glerbl/repo_conf.py">.glerbl/repo_conf.py</a>. So you either have to
install glerbl to get those checks done for you or run the checks
through other means. See <a class="reference internal" href="#contributing">Contributing</a>.</p>

<div class="section" id="building">
<h1>Building<a class="headerlink" href="#building" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Everything generated during a build is output to the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">build/</span></tt>

</div>
<p>The Makefile will download external packages (like jquery and
Bootstrap) and place them in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">downloads/</span></tt>. It will then create a

in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">build/standalone/</span></tt>. As the name &#8220;standalone&#8221; implies, this build
includes <strong>everything</strong> needed to run wed on your own server, except
the configuration for RequireJS.</p>
<p>Make will additionally create an optimized version of wed in
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">build/standalone-optimized/</span></tt>. This is a version that has been
optimized using RequireJS&#8217;s <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">r.js</span></tt> optimizer. This optimization
exists for illustration purposes and for testing wed. See the
<a class="reference internal" href="tech_notes.html#tech-notes-deployment-considerations"><em>Deployment Considerations</em></a> section in <a class="reference internal" href="tech_notes.html"><em>Advanced Usage Notes</em></a> to

</li>
</ul>
<p>It is possible to run the kitchen sink with a different mode than the

<span id="id1"></span><h2>Label Visibility<a class="headerlink" href="#label-visibility" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Wed allows the user to reduce or increase the number of element
labeled on the screen. How this works is dependent in part on the
specific mode that the user has selected. For instance, the default
mode that comes with wed (the &#8220;generic&#8221; mode) knows only two levels of
visiblity: 0 and 1. At level 0, no elements are labeled. At level 1,
all elements are labeled. A mode with levels 0, 1, and 2 would label
all elements at level 2, no elements at level 0 and some elements at
level 1. Which elements are labeled depends on how the mode designer
designed the mode.</p>

<li><p class="first">Instantiate an <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Editor</span></tt> object of that module as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>var editor = new wed.Editor();
[...]
editor.init(widget, options, data);</pre>
</div>
<p>Between the creation of the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Editor</span></tt> object and the call to
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">init</span></tt>, there conceivably could be some calls to add event
handlers or condition handlers. The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">widget</span></tt> parameter must be an
element (preferably a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">div</span></tt>) that wed will take over to install
its GUI. The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">options</span></tt> parameter is a dictionary which at present
understands the following keys:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">schema</span></tt>: the path to the schema to use for interpreting the
document. This file must contain the result of doing the schema
conversion required by salve since wed uses salve. See
salve&#8217;s documentation.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mode</span></tt>: a simple object recording mode parameters. This object
must have a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">path</span></tt> field set to the RequireJS path of the
mode. An optional <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">options</span></tt> field may contain options to be
passed to the mode. Wed comes bundled with a generic mode located
at <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mangalam-research/wed/blob/master/lib/wed/modes/generic/generic.js">lib/wed/modes/generic/generic.js</a>.</p>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">path</span></tt> field may be abbreviated. For instance if wed is
given the path <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&quot;foo&quot;</span></tt>, it will try to load the module
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">foo</span></tt>. If this fails, it will try to load <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">modes/foo/foo</span></tt>.  If
this fails, it will try to load <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">modes/foo/foo_mode</span></tt>. These

necessary to handle some configuration scenarios.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Wed will get a configuration from RequireJS <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">module.config()</span></tt> and

object and in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">options</span></tt> object, the latter value will override
the former. <strong>Note that it is not possible to undefine a value set
in ``module.config()``</strong> because <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">$.extend</span></tt> ignores undefined
values. One way around this problem is to specify
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ignore_module_config</span></tt> in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">options</span></tt> object. See the
RequireJS documentation. The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">wed/wed</span></tt> configuration in
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mangalam-research/wed/blob/master/config/requirejs-config-dev.js">config/requirejs-config-dev.js</a> gives an example of how
this can be used.</p>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">data</span></tt> parameter is a string containing the document to edit,

<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mangalam-research/wed/blob/master/lib/wed/onerror.js">lib/wed/onerror.js</a> module installs a global onerror

at the time of installation. Sometimes this is not the desired
behavior (for instance when testing with mocha). In such cases the

is running could trip wed&#8217;s onerror handler and cause wed
to think it crashed. For this reason you must not run
wed with JavaScript code that causes onerror to fire.</p>

<p>At this stage wed does not guarantee that saving an <strong>unmodified</strong>
document will sent the exact same string as what it was originally
given to edit. This is due to the fact that the same document can be
represented in XML in multiple ways. Notably:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Comments, CDATA, and processing instructions are not preserved.</li>
<li>The order of the attributes could differ.</li>
<li>The order and location of namespaces declarations could differ.</li>
<li>The encoding of empty elements could differ. That is, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;foo&gt;&lt;/foo&gt;</span></tt>
could become <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;foo/&gt;</span></tt> or vice-versa.</li>
<li>The presence or absence of a newline on the last line may not be
preserved.</li>

<p>Contributions must pass the commit checks turned on in

hooks. Glerbl itself can be found at
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/lddubeau/glerbl">https://github.com/lddubeau/glerbl</a>. It will eventually make its way to
the Python package repository so that <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pip</span> <span class="pre">install</span> <span class="pre">glerbl</span></tt> will
work.</p>
