<h1>Basic Usage<a class="headerlink" href="#basic-usage" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Wed is a web-based editor that assists users in editing XML documents
according to their own Relax NG schema. It runs in a web browser. It
is alpha software. We aim to make it extensible, but the API is likely
to change until we hit version 1.0.0.</p>
<p>Known limitations:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Wed currently does understand a large subset of Relax NG, but some
constructs are not supported. See the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mangalam-research/salve/">salve</a> package for details.</li>
<li>Wed does not currently support editing attributes in a
generic way <em>as attributes</em>. The functionality just has not been
implemented <strong>yet</strong> because wed is developed in the context of a
project where all attributes are set by software or are edited
through domain-specific abstractions rather than directly, as
attributes. Other features are more pressing.</li>
<li>Empty elements appear in the editor as if they had an opening and
closing tag, irrespective of how they are encoded in the original
document. So <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;foo/&gt;</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;foo&gt;&lt;/foo&gt;</span></tt> are treated the
same. Part of this problem is due to the fact that wed sees the
document as a DOM tree, not as a serialization. In a DOM tree,
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;foo/&gt;</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;foo&gt;&lt;/foo&gt;</span></tt> are the same.</li>
<li>Elements that <em>cannot</em> contain anything appear in the editor as if
they <em>could</em>. The validator raises an error if these elements are
filled with any contents but it would be nicer if they were
displayed in a way that distinguished them from the elements that
<em>can</em> be filled with contents. We worked on a prototype that would
check whether an element <em>can</em> contain anything and display it
differently if it could not. However, this required that the
rendering engine query the validating engine during rendering, which
made rendering extremely slow. Since the editor will raise an error
if an element that should be empty is filled erroneously, we&#8217;ve
decided that a solution to this problem can wait.</li>
<li>Eventually the plan is to handle XML namespace changes completely,
and there is incipient code to deal with this; for now the safe
thing to do if you have a file using multiple namespaces is to
declare them once and for all on the top element, and never change
them throughout the document. Otherwise, problems are likely.</li>
<li>We&#8217;ve not tested a setup in which more than one wed instance appears
on the same page.</li>
<li>Keyboard navigation in contextual menus works. However, if the mouse
is hovering over menu items, two items will be highlighted at once,
which may be confusing. This seems to be a limitation of CSS which
Bootstrap does nothing to deal with. (One element may be in the
focused state (keyboard) while another is in the hover state.)</li>
<li>Wed does not work with RTL scripts. There no inherent reason wed
could not support them but the project for which it is developed
currently does not need support for RTL scripts. So no resources
have been expended towards supporting this.</li>
<li>Wed is not internationalized. Although the contents of a document
could be in any language, wed&#8217;s UI is in English. Again, there is no
inherent reason wed could not support other languages for the
UI. The project for which it is developed currently does not need
support for other languages, hence this state of affairs.</li>
<li>See also <a class="reference internal" href="#browser-requirements">Browser Requirements</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Known bugs:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Firefox: Sometimes a caret moved to the end of a bit of text
disappears. There does not seem to be any rhyme or reason for it. It
is probably a Firefox bug. At any rate, wed does not currently
compensate for it. So you may see your caret disappear, but it is
still there, waiting for you to type text.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="browser-requirements">
<h1>Browser Requirements<a class="headerlink" href="#browser-requirements" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Wed is primarily developed using a recent version of Chrome (version
35; versions 26-34 have also been used earlier) and a recent version
of Firefox (version 28; versions 20-27 have also been used earlier)
for testing. The fact that wed is developed using these browsers
influences the severity and frequency of bugs you can expect to run
into.</p>
<p>Here is the list of officially supported browsers, in order of
decreasing priority:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Chrome 35 and higher and Firefox 28 and higher, about equally.</li>
<li>IE 10 and 11, about equally.</li>
</ul>
<p>File an issue on github if you find a problem with one of the
supported browsers above. IE 9 is neither supported nor
unsupported. See the section on <a class="reference internal" href="#ie-9">IE 9</a> below for an explanation.</p>
<p>We would like to support phone and tablet browsers but due to a lack
of development resources, such support is unlikely to materialize
soon. In decreasing order of likelihood, the following cases are
unlikely to ever be supported:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Versions of Chrome and Firefox older than those mentioned above.</li>
<li>IE 8 and earlier.</li>
<li>Antique browsers.</li>
<li>Oddball browsers or other software or hardware systems that present
web pages. (E.g. gaming consoles, smart TVs.)</li>
<li>Operating systems or browsers no longer supported by their own
vendors.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="ie-9">
<h2>IE 9<a class="headerlink" href="#ie-9" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Is it safe to use wed with IE 9? Probably.</p>
<p>Some work has been done to support IE 9. However, as of 2013-03-20
three tests of the Selenium test suite fail intermitently in IE 9. It
is not possible to reproduce the failures manually, which makes it
really hard to debug. Since the failures only occur in Selenium, some
sort of logging at the JavaScript level must be performed to figure
out what is going on. However, IE 9 does not seem to have any facility
that readily allows producing stack traces. Methods that work on
Chrome, Firefox, IE 10 and 11 do not work in IE 9. The only method we
know for IE 9 relies on using the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">caller</span></tt> argument, which is turned
off when strict mode is in use. Using this method would mean turning
off strict mode in wed <strong>and</strong> in any third-party library that happens
to be on the stack when the trace is produced. Not a trivial
matter. So for now IE 9 is not officially supported.</p>
<p>You may use it. And we will listen to bug reports concerning it. But
there are no guarantees.</p>
<p>If you are in a position to contribute substantial monetary or
technical resources towards making IE 9 officially supported, you are
welcome to contact us.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="os-x">
<h2>OS X<a class="headerlink" href="#os-x" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The test suite depends on native events to do its work, but support
for native events in OS X is spotty:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Chrome: it is possible to generate <em>some</em> native events.</li>
<li>Firefox reports that it does not support native events at all.</li>
<li>Safari does not support native events at all.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your best bet in OS X is to use Chrome because we can&#8217;t run the test
suite with Firefox or Safari.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="safari">
<h2>Safari<a class="headerlink" href="#safari" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Safari is a vexing case. Wed may or may not work on Safari. We
currently cannot run the automated test suite with Safari. Manual
testing is out of the question.</p>
<p>We would like to have wed be supported on recent versions of Safari to
the same extent it is supported on recent versions of Chrome, Firefox
and IE. The tool we use to test it is Selenium. For better or for
worse this is the go-to tool to do the kind of test wed
needs. Selenium&#8217;s support for Chrome and Firefox benefits from
collaboration from developers who are responsible for developing these
two browsers. In the case of IE, it appears (from reading bug reports)
that Microsoft is communicating with the Selenium developers to
resolve issues. However, we&#8217;ve not seen evidence of any collaboration
between the Selenium project and Apple. Thus testing support for
Safari is deficient, and it is not something that we here have the
resources to fix.</p>
<p>If you desire that wed be actually tested on Safari and are in a
position to contribute substantial monetary or technical resources
towards this goal, you are welcome to contact us. In particular,
immediate problem we&#8217;ve run into when trying to test on Safari is this
[Selenium
issue](<a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=4136">http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=4136</a>). If
you want fix it, then this would bring us one step closer to being
able to test wed on Safari. And regarding the state of Selenium
support for Safari, take note this response from a Selenium project
member:</p>
<p>&gt; Safari is not a priority, sorry. But your patches are welcome!</p>
<p>Absent these patches, wed is unlikely to support Safari.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you feel the urge to write an email saying &#8220;You
should just...&#8221;, then please abstain because there is nothing &#8220;just&#8221;
about testing web applications.</p>

<div class="section" id="dependencies">
<h1>Dependencies<a class="headerlink" href="#dependencies" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Wed is packaged as a RequireJS module. To use it in a browser
environment, you need to first load RequireJS and pass to it a
configuration that will allow it to find wed&#8217;s code. An example of
such configuration, which allows running the browser-dependent test
suite, is located in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mangalam-research/wed/blob/develop/config/requirejs-config-dev.js">config/requirejs-config-dev.js</a>.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">

<em>there</em>. This directory is not tracked by git.</p>
</div>
<p>Please see the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mangalam-research/wed/blob/develop/package.json">package.json</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mangalam-research/wed/blob/develop/config/requirejs-config-dev.js">config/requirejs-config-dev.js</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mangalam-research/wed/blob/develop/Makefile">Makefile</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mangalam-research/wed/blob/develop/build.mk">build.mk</a> files for details regarding run-time and
development dependencies. Running the test suite also requires that
<a class="reference external" href="http://saxon.sourceforge.net/">saxon</a> be installed.</p>
<p>Building wed&#8217;s documentation <strong>additionally</strong> requires the following
packages:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>jsdoc3</li>
<li>rst2html</li>
<li>perl (a stop-gap measure which we plan to get rid of eventually)</li>
</ul>
<p>Running wed&#8217;s selenium-based tests <strong>additionally</strong> requires the
following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Python 2.7.</li>
<li>Python&#8217;s Selenium package.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://github.com/mangalam-research/selenic">selenic</a></li>
<li>behave (the python package)</li>
<li>nginx is highly recommended but optional.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to contribute to wed, your code will have to pass the
checks listed in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mangalam-research/wed/blob/develop/.glerbl/repo_conf.py">.glerbl/repo_conf.py</a>. So you either have to
install glerbl to get those checks done for you or run the checks
through other means. See <a class="reference internal" href="#contributing">Contributing</a>.</p>

<p>For now, wed uses a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Makefile</span></tt> and associated <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">build.mk</span></tt> to build
itself. You might want to create a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">local.mk</span></tt> file to record
settings specific to your own build environment. See the start of the
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mangalam-research/wed/blob/develop/build.mk">build.mk</a> to see what variables you can set. When everything

</div>
<p>The Makefile will download external packages (like jquery and

includes <strong>everything</strong> needed to run wed on your own server, except
the configuration for RequireJS.</p>
<p>Make will additionally create an optimized version of wed in
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">build/standalone-optimized/</span></tt>. This is a version that has been
optimized using RequireJS&#8217;s <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">r.js</span></tt> optimizer. This optimization
exists for illustration purposes and for testing wed. See the
<a class="reference internal" href="tech_notes.html#tech-notes-deployment-considerations"><em>Deployment Considerations</em></a> section in <a class="reference internal" href="tech_notes.html"><em>Advanced Usage Notes</em></a> to

<p>Wed allows the user to reduce or increase the number of element
labeled on the screen. How this works is dependent in part on the
specific mode that the user has selected. For instance, the default
mode that comes with wed (the &#8220;generic&#8221; mode) knows only two levels of
visiblity: 0 and 1. At level 0, no elements are labeled. At level 1,
all elements are labeled. A mode with levels 0, 1, and 2 would label
all elements at level 2, no elements at level 0 and some elements at
level 1. Which elements are labeled depends on how the mode designer
designed the mode.</p>

<div class="section" id="using">
<h1>Using<a class="headerlink" href="#using" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Wed expects the XML files it uses to have been converted from XML to
an ad-hoc HTML version. So the data passed to it must have been
converted by <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mangalam-research/wed/blob/develop/lib/wed/xml-to-html.xsl">lib/wed/xml-to-html.xsl</a>. Various schemas and projects
will have different needs regarding white space handling, so it is
likely you&#8217;ll want to create your own <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">xml-to-html.xsl</span></tt> file that will
import <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mangalam-research/wed/blob/develop/lib/wed/xml-to-html.xsl">lib/wed/xml-to-html.xsl</a> but customize white space handling.</p>
<p>To include wed in a web page you must:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Require <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mangalam-research/wed/blob/develop/lib/wed/wed.js">lib/wed/wed.js</a></p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Instantiate an <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Editor</span></tt> object of that module as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>var editor = new wed.Editor();
[...]
editor.init(widget, options);</pre>
</div>
<p>Between the creation of the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Editor</span></tt> object and the call to
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">init</span></tt>, there conceivably could be some calls to add event
handlers or condition handlers. The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">widget</span></tt> parameter must be an
element (preferably a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">div</span></tt>) which contains the entire data
structure to edit (converted by <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">xml-to-html.xsl</span></tt> or a
customization of it). The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">options</span></tt> parameter is a dictionary
which at present understands the following keys:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">schema</span></tt>: the path to the schema to use for interpreting the
document. This file must contain the result of doing the schema
conversion required by salve since wed uses salve. See
salve&#8217;s documentation.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mode</span></tt>: a simple object recording mode parameters. This object
must have a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">path</span></tt> field set to the RequireJS path of the
mode. An optional <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">options</span></tt> field may contain options to be
passed to the mode. Wed comes bundled with a generic mode located
at <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mangalam-research/wed/blob/develop/lib/wed/modes/generic/generic.js">lib/wed/modes/generic/generic.js</a>.</p>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">path</span></tt> field may be abbreviated. For instance if wed is
given the path <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&quot;foo&quot;</span></tt>, it will try to load the module
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">foo</span></tt>. If this fails, it will try to load <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">modes/foo/foo</span></tt>.  If
this fails, it will try to load <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">modes/foo/foo_mode</span></tt>. These
paths are all relative to the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">wed/</span></tt> root directory.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ajaxlog</span></tt>: See the documentation about <a class="reference internal" href="tech_notes.html#remote-logging"><em>remote logging</em></a>.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>If <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">options</span></tt> is absent, wed will attempt getting its configuration
from RequireJS by calling <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">module.config()</span></tt>. See the RequireJS
documentation. The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">wed/wed</span></tt> configuration in
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mangalam-research/wed/blob/develop/config/requirejs-config-dev.js">config/requirejs-config-dev.js</a> gives an example of how this can
be used.</p>

<p>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mode.options</span></tt> will be passed to the generic mode when it is
created. What options are accepted and what they mean is determined by
each mode.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mangalam-research/wed/blob/develop/lib/wed/onerror.js">lib/wed/onerror.js</a> module installs a global onerror
handler. By default it calls whatever onerror handler already existed
at the time of installation. Sometimes this is not the desired
behavior (for instance when testing with mocha). In such cases the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">suppress_old_onerror</span></tt> option set to a true value will prevent the
module from calling the old onerror.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="first admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p class="last">Wed installs its own handler so that if any error occurs
it knows about it, attempts to save the data and forces
the user to reload. The unfortunate upshot of this is
that any other JavaScript executing on a page where wed
is running could trip wed&#8217;s onerror handler and cause wed
to think it crashed. For this reason you must not run
wed with JavaScript code that causes onerror to fire.</p>

<h1>Round-Tripping<a class="headerlink" href="#round-tripping" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The transformations performed by <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mangalam-research/wed/blob/develop/lib/wed/xml-to-html.xsl">lib/wed/xml-to-html.xsl</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mangalam-research/wed/blob/develop/lib/wed/html-to-xml.xsl">lib/wed/html-to-xml.xsl</a> are not byte-for-byte reverse
operations. Suppose document A is converted from xml to html, remains
unmodified, and is converted back and saved as B, B will <strong>mean</strong> the
same thing as A but will not necessarily be <strong>identical</strong> to A. Here are
the salient points:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Comments, CDATA, and processing instructions are lost.</li>
<li>The order of attributes could change.</li>
<li>The order and location of namespaces could change.</li>
<li>The encoding of empty elements could change. That is, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;foo/&gt;</span></tt> could
become <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;foo&gt;&lt;/foo&gt;</span></tt> or vice-versa.</li>
<li>The presence or absence of a newline on the last line may not be
preserved.</li>
