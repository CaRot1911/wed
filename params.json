{"name":"Wed","tagline":"Web editor","body":"Introduction\r\n============\r\n\r\nWed is a schema-aware editor for XML documents. It runs in a web browser. It is alpha software. We aim to make it extensible, but the API is likely to change quickly for now. Please see our [README](https://github.com/mangalam-research/wed) for the technical details.\r\n\r\nDemo\r\n====\r\n\r\nThe [demo](build/standalone/kitchen-sink.html) currently starts with an empty document using a vanilla TEI schema. Here are some limitations of the demo:\r\n\r\n* Wed does not support old browsers, mobile devices, oddball, or unpopular browsers. Your notion of \"old\" might differ from ours.\r\n* Wed will fail if you try to save. Rest assured that the saving functionality works but it needs a server able to handle AJAX calls. Github.io is not able to do this.\r\n* You cannot edit attributes in a generic way, *as attributes*. The functionality just has not implemented **yet** because wed is developed in the context of a project where all attributes are set by software or are edited through domain-specific abstractions rather than directly, as attributes.\r\n\r\nThings you can do:\r\n\r\n* Use the left mouse button to bring up a context menu. Such a menu exists for starting tags and all positions that are editable. This menu allows inserting elements. Ctrl-/ also brings up this menu.\r\n* Insert text where text is valid.\r\n* Ctrl-Z to undo.\r\n* Ctrl-Y to redo.\r\n* Ctrl-C to copy.\r\n* Ctrl-V to paste.\r\n* Ctrl-X to cut.\r\n* Using Ctrl-S to save does not work, for the reasons given above.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n=======\r\n\r\nWed is released under the [Mozilla Public License version 2.0](http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/>).
