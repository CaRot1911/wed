<h1>Wed&#8217;s Help<a class="headerlink" href="#wed-s-help" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The following help covers the basic features of wed. There are some
important caveats to keep in mind when reading this documentation.</p>
<p>First caveat. Wed is designed to be an XML editor that provides on the
fly validation, and <em>only</em> this. Consequently, wed has no notion of a
&#8220;document collection&#8221; and provides no means to load documents from a
collection or save documents under some name into a
collection. Functions such as these are to be provided by the larger
application in which wed is being used. <strong>The following documentation
does not cover the functions which are outside the scope of wed.</strong></p>
<p>Second caveat. The functions of wed are exposed to the user through
<em>editing modes</em> (usually just referred to as &#8220;modes&#8221;). It is possible
to use wed with custom modes that present the document differently
from what the generic mode does, or include toolbars, menus, dialogs,
etc. <strong>The following documentation covers only what the generic mode
(bundled with wed) provides.</strong> Custom modes will have to provide their
own documentation.</p>
<p>Third caveat. Make sure that wed is supported on your browser before
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mangalam-research/wed/issues">filing a bug report</a>. See <a class="reference internal" href="#browser-requirements">Browser
Requirements</a>.</p>
<div class="section" id="editing-controls">
<h2>Editing Controls<a class="headerlink" href="#editing-controls" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Wed divides the screen into various areas.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-validation-progress-bar">
<h3>The Validation Progress Bar<a class="headerlink" href="#the-validation-progress-bar" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>As you edit your document, wed validates your document according to
the Relax NG schema that was specified when wed was started. Whenever
you make a change to the document, wed revalidates the document.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">At the moment, wed itself does not provide a GUI to select
different schemas. It is up to the software that uses wed to
provide to the user the means to select a schema. How to do
this depends on the needs of the project. For instance, wed
is used in <a class="reference external" href="https://btw.mangalamresearch.org">BTW</a> to allow
the editing of scholarly documents. There there can be only
one schema in use and thus no need to ask the user to select
a schema.</p>
</div>
<p>The validation progress bar is located above the editing pane. The
image below shows the general location of the bar.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">The location of the validation bar.</span></p>
</div>
<p>When an document is first loaded, or when a revalidation occurs, the
bar starts empty (all white). It is progressively filled with color as
validation proceeds. For small documents, validation will occur very
quickly and consequently the user will see the bar instantly fill to
completion. The color of the bar and the status that appears in the
center of the bar will vary depending on the results of validation.</p>

<h3>Modification and Save Status<a class="headerlink" href="#modification-and-save-status" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>On the left side of the screen, at the top, wed shows you the
modification and save status of the document being edited.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id9">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/modification_and_save_status.png"><img alt="This image shows the location of the modification and save status, on the top left side of the screen." src="_images/modification_and_save_status.png" style="width: 634.0px; height: 144.0px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">The location of the modification and save status.</span></p>
</div>
<p>The rectangle on the left is the modification status. A green
modification status indicates that the document has not been modified
since it has last been loaded or last saved. To the right of the
modification status is the save status. It starts gray to indicate
that the document has never been saved <em>during the current editing
session.</em></p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id10">
<img alt="An unmodified and unsaved status." src="_images/unmodified_unsaved.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">The status shown for a document that has not been modified since
last loaded and has not yet been saved in this editing session.</span></p>
</div>
<p>When you modify the document, the modification status becomes orange
and contains an asterisk to indicate that the document in the editor
has modifications that have not been saved yet.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id11">
<img alt="A modified and unsaved status." src="_images/modified_unsaved.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">The status shown for a document that has been modified since
last loaded and has not yet been saved in this editing session.</span></p>
</div>
<p>When you save manually (for instance, by doing <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">Ctrl-S</span></code>), the
modification status returns to green and the saved status becomes
green. The saved status also tells you how long ago the last save
occurred. Hovering on the save status brings up a tooltip telling you
what kind of save last occurred: autosave, or manual save.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">The delay between autosaves is configurable, and can be
turned off by the application which makes use of wed. The
availability of autosaves and the delay between autosaves
is determined by the application which makes use of wed for
editing.</p>

<div class="section" id="the-error-pane">
<h3>The Error Pane<a class="headerlink" href="#the-error-pane" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>On the left of the screen, under the modification and save status, you
can find the error pane. This is where XML validation errors are shown
to the user.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id14">
<img alt="The location of the error pane." src="_images/error_pane.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">The error pane.</span></p>
</div>
<p>The error pane is collapsible. It can be collapsed or expanded by
clicking on the pane&#8217;s heading. Clicking on <a class="reference internal" href="#error-markers">error markers</a> in the editing pane will expand the error pane. Clicking on
an error description in the error pane will scroll the editing pane to
the location of the error. It will also make the error &#8220;selected&#8221;. The
selected error has its description blinking in the error page and has
its error marker blinking in the editing pane.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id15">
<img alt="Shows what happens when the user clicks on an error description." src="_images/click_on_error_description.gif" />

</div>
<div class="section" id="the-navigation-pane">
<h3>The Navigation Pane<a class="headerlink" href="#the-navigation-pane" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The navigation pane is a basic functionality of wed but will be
visible only if a mode makes use of it. <strong>The generic mode does not
make use of the navigation pane.</strong> The generic mode is meant to be
truly <em>generic</em> and thus does not know what elements serve as section
headings in a document. Therefore, it does not know how to build the
content of the navigation pane. So if you are using the generic mode,
you won&#8217;t see it.</p>
<p>Custom modes that make use of the pane will show this pane under the
<a class="reference internal" href="#modification-and-save-status">modification and save status</a>, above
the error pane.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id16">
<img alt="Shows where the navigation pane is situated." src="_images/navigation_pane.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">The navigation pane.</span></p>
</div>
<p>The user can click on the headings in the navigation pane to quickly
scroll the editing pane to the corresponding area of the
document. Some modes may also support bringing up special contextual
menus on the headings of the navigation pane.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-location-bar">
<h3>The Location Bar<a class="headerlink" href="#the-location-bar" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The location bar appears right under the editing pane. It indicates
the hierarchy of elements that contain the caret. Each XML element in
the hierarchy is separated from the next by a forward slash (<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/</span></code>).</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id17">
<img alt="Shows where the location bar is situated." src="_images/location_bar.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">The location bar.</span></p>
</div>
<p>In the example above, reading from the end of the location bar, the
caret is located in a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">note</span></code> element contained by a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">notesStmt</span></code>
element contained by a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">biblFull</span></code> element, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-editing-pane">
<h3>The Editing Pane<a class="headerlink" href="#the-editing-pane" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The editing pane is where the document being edited is displayed and
where most changes to a document are performed. It appears under the
validation progress bar, above the location bar and to the right of
the error pane.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id18">
<img alt="Shows where the editing pane is located." src="_images/editing_pane.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">The editing pane.</span></p>
</div>
<p>If the document is too long for the space given to wed, the editing
pane will show a scroll bar on the right that allows scrolling the
document.</p>
<p>We will now go over each distinctive element of the editing pane.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-caret">
<h4>The Caret<a class="headerlink" href="#the-caret" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The caret indicates where the document is being edited. It is a
blinking vertical bar. It can be moved by left clicking. When the
caret is already in the document, the arrow keys on your keyboard can
be used to move the caret.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id19">
<img alt="Shows the caret." src="_images/caret.gif" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">The caret can be moved with left clicks of the mouse or the arrow
keys.</span></p>
</div>
<p>The element that contains the caret also acquires a pale yellow
background color while the caret is in it. Only the element which
immediately contains the caret acquires this color. The elements that
contain this element do not change background color.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="placeholders">
<h4>Placeholders<a class="headerlink" href="#placeholders" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Empty elements contain placeholders. The placeholders are meant to
help users easily put the caret in empty elements. Without the
placeholder, the start and end labels of empty elements would be
immediately adjacent, and getting the caret between them would be more
difficult. (It would require clicking on the start label and moving
right or clicking on the end label and moving left.) When an element
is edited to contain text or other elements, it loses its
placeholder. When an element is emptied it gains a placeholder.  When
the caret is in a placeholder, the placeholder blinks to indicate that
it contains the caret.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id20">
<img alt="Text editing add and removes placeholders." src="_images/placeholder.gif" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">The <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">hi</span></code> element gains a placeholder when the text is removed,
and loses the placeholder when text is added back.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Placeholders also appear as the value of those attributes which have
no value set.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="element-labels">
<h4>Element Labels<a class="headerlink" href="#element-labels" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>By default, the generic mode bundled with wed shows the start of each
XML element with a start label, and the end of each XML element with
an end label. The start and end labels can be distinguished from one
another by the fact that a start label ends with a right angle bracket
(<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&gt;</span></code>) and an end label starts with a left angle bracket (<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;</span></code>).</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">It is possible for custom modes to display elements using
more specialized rendering, and omit the start and end
labels. For instance, a custom mode could distinguish
&#8220;paragraph&#8221; elements through line breaks and indentation,
and omit the start and end labels of these elements.</p>
</div>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id21">
<img alt="An example of start and end labels." src="_images/start_end_labels.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">This figure contains a total of 8 labels: two start labels for two
elements <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">p</span></code>, and the corresponding two end labels, two start
labels for two elements <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">hi</span></code> and the corresponding two end
labels.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Clicking on an element&#8217;s label selects the element and allows the user
to perform actions on the element as a whole. When the element is
selected, both the start and end labels are colored orange.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id22">

</div>
<p>Right-clicking on an element label will bring up a <a class="reference internal" href="#contextual-menus">contextual menu</a> appropriate for the element. Start labels may
contain the attributes associated with the XML element to which the
label belongs. For each attribute, the label first shows the
attribute&#8217;s name, followed by the equal sign (<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">=</span></code>) and the attribute
value in double quotes (<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&quot;</span></code>). The attribute&#8217;s value appears in black
on a white background.</p>

</div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">Attribute visibility is determined by the mode being used to
edit the file, and how this mode is configured. The generic
mode by default shows attributes. It is possible for an
application using wed to configure the generic mode to hide
attributes. Custom modes may be designed to hide attributes
too.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">When a double quote appears as part of an attribute&#8217;s value,
wed will show the double quote as a double quote. In other
words, it does not visually escape it. <strong>However, wed does
encode double quotes appearing in an attribute&#8217;s value
properly.</strong></p>
</div>
<p>Whenever the mode being used has provided element documentation,
hovering over a label will bring up a tooltip with the documentation
of the element.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id24">
<img alt="An example of a start label with its tooltip open." src="_images/label_tooltip.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">This figure shows a label for a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">p</span></code> element whose tooltip is
open. The tooltip contains documentation on the element.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Whether documentation is actually available depends on the
mode being used and how the mode was configured and packaged
with wed.</p>
<p class="last">Element documentation is not provided by wed itself. The
generic mode used in Wed&#8217;s demo is set to work with TEI
documents, and thus provide documentations on TEI
elements. This documentation was converted for use by wed
but its contents was created by the authors of the TEI
schema. Wed merely extracted it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="label-visibility">
<h5>Label Visibility<a class="headerlink" href="#label-visibility" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>The editing modes of wed can be designed to assign different levels of
visibility to labels. Imagine for instance a mode that represents
breaks in paragraphs through line breaks and indentation, or foreign
text by showing it in italics, and so on. For each element that is

<h4>Contextual Menus<a class="headerlink" href="#contextual-menus" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Right-clicking on element labels or in the text contained by elements
or attributes brings up a contextual menu. As the term &#8220;contextual&#8221;
suggests, the content of the menu is determined by the location where
the contextual menu is being invoked. In particular, the list of
operations available in the menu is determined by what the Relax NG
schema that governs the editing session allows in the specific
location where the menu was invoked. For instance, if an element
allows only the attributes <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">a</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">b</span></code>, and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">b</span></code> is already
present on the element, then the contextual menu that you get when
right-clicking on the start label of the element will show only an
option to add the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">a</span></code> attribute, because adding a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">b</span></code> attribute
again would not be valid.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id29">
<img alt="A contextual menu." src="_images/contextual_menu.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">This is a contextual menu brought up on the start label of the
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">title</span></code> element.</span></p>
</div>
<p>The top of the contextual menu contains buttons and an input field
that allow filtering the list of options presented by the menu. When
editing a document using a complex schema, there can be dozens of
options available. Filtering helps finding the desired option
quickly.</p>
<p>The input field filters the options that pertain to attributes or
elements on the basis of attribute name or element name. It filters
other options on the basis of the name of the option shown in the
menu. When you bring up the contextual menu, the input field is
focused automatically, so you can type in it right away, without
having to focus it with the mouse.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id30">
<img alt="Using the input field to filter entries in the contextual menu." src="_images/contextual_menu_text_filter.gif" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">The user brings up a contextual menu and filters options to those
that contain the text <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">xml</span></code>.</span></p>
</div>
<p>The buttons above the input field allow filtering the list of options
according to characteristics other than text. The buttons are divided
into two groups: the first group filters by the kind of operation
performed, the second group filters by what kind of XML construct the
operation affects. Hovering the mouse over each button will give you a
description of the filtering performed by the button. The buttons in
the first group filter as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><img alt="add" src="_images/filter_add.png" /> filters the list of options to those that add content. For
instance, adding elements and attributes.</li>
<li><img alt="delete" src="_images/filter_delete.png" /> filters the list of options to those that delete
content. For instance, deleting elements and attributes.</li>
<li><img alt="wrap" src="_images/filter_wrap.png" /> filters the list of options to those that wrap content into
an element. For instance, wrapping text into a new element.</li>
<li><img alt="unwrap" src="_images/filter_unwrap.png" /> filters the list of options to those that unwrap
content. For instance, unwrapping an element.</li>
<li><img alt="other" src="_images/filter_other.png" /> filters the list of options to those that are not in one of
the previous categories.</li>
</ul>
<p>The buttons of the second group filter as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>&lt; filters the list of options to those that perform operations on
XML elements. For instance, if you select this filter, then all
options that edit attributes would be removed.</li>
<li>&#64; filters the list of options to those that perform operations on
XML attributes. For instance, if you select this filter, then all
options that edit elements will be removed.</li>
<li><img alt="other" src="_images/filter_other.png" /> filters the list of options to those that are not in one of
the previous categories. Therefore, it would filter the list of
options to remove those options that perform operations on elements
or attributes.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first characters typed into the input field can serve to select
the buttons listed above by means of the keyboard rather than using
the mouse. When one of these keys is used to select a button, this key
only performs the task of selecting a button <em>but does not appear in
the input field</em>. The keys recognized are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">+</span></code> selects <img alt="add" src="_images/filter_add.png" /></li>
<li><code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">-</span></code> selects <img alt="delete" src="_images/filter_delete.png" /></li>
<li><code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">,</span></code> selects <img alt="wrap" src="_images/filter_wrap.png" /></li>
<li><code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">.</span></code> selects <img alt="unwrap" src="_images/filter_unwrap.png" /></li>
<li><code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">?</span></code> selects <img alt="other" src="_images/filter_other.png" /> in the first group of buttons. That is, it
filters options to those that do not add, delete, wrap or unwrap.</li>
<li><code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;</span></code> selects &lt;</li>
<li><code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">&#64;</span></code> selects &#64;</li>
<li><code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">!</span></code> selects <img alt="other" src="_images/filter_other.png" /> in the second group of buttons. That is, it
filters options to those that do not operate on elements or
attributes.</li>
<li><code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">ESC</span></code> resets filtering. It will clear all the filtering buttons
and will clear the input field. If no filtering was in effect, then
it will close the contextual menu.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once a button has been selected, <em>either with the mouse or by using
one of the keys above</em>, then the keys that select filters from that
group no longer have for effect to select filters. Instead, they will
be added into the input field, just like any other key. Here are some
examples of this behavior:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>If the user opens a contextual menu and types <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">+</span></code>, this will have
for effect to select the <img alt="add" src="_images/filter_add.png" /> button and filter the options to
those that add content. So far so good. Then if the user types
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-</span></code>, this will <em>not</em> unselect <img alt="add" src="_images/filter_add.png" /> to select <img alt="delete" src="_images/filter_delete.png" />
instead. Rather, the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-</span></code> character will appear literally in the
input field so that the end result will be that only options that
add content and operate on attribute or elements which have <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-</span></code> in
their name.</li>
<li>If the user opens a contextual menu and types <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">+</span></code>, and then <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&#64;</span></code>,
the <img alt="add" src="_images/filter_add.png" /> and &#64; buttons will be selected and the list will show only
those options that add attributes. After the user types <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">+</span></code>, the
keys associated with the first group of buttons cease to select
buttons, but those associated with the second group continue to be
available to select one of the buttons in the second group. Once
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&#64;</span></code> has been typed too, then none of the keys that select buttons
perform button selections anymore.</li>
</ul>
<p>Resetting filtering by typing <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">ESC</span></code> resets this behavior. In
other words, the keys that select buttons become operational
again.</p>
<p>It is possible to select an option from the contextual menu by using
the up and down arrow keys on the keyboard and typing <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">ENTER</span></code> on
the desired option. <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">ESC</span></code> closes the contextual menu without
performing a selection, provided there is no filtering in effect,
otherwise it will clear the filtering. If filtering is in effect, then
using <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">ESC</span></code> twice in a row will close the contextual menu.</p>

arrows and <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">ENTER</span></code> to complete the value already begun. It is
possible also to just type the whole value at the keyboard (which may

<ul class="simple">
<li>Chrome 47 and higher.</li>

of development resources, such support is unlikely to materialize
soon. In decreasing order of likelihood, the following cases are
unlikely to ever be supported:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Versions of Chrome older than those mentioned above.</li>
<li>Firefox. It deserves its own <a class="reference internal" href="#firefox">discussion</a>.</li>
<li>IE 10. Wed used to be routinely tested on IE 10, but Microsoft no
longer supports it. It is very unlikely that we&#8217;d resume support for
IE 10. We&#8217;d need a) a substantial demand for it and b) people
willing to participate in providing support.</li>
<li>IE 9. Same caveats as IE 10 above. Moreover, as time goes by, wed is
accumulating features that are not supported natively in IE 9, so

<h3>Firefox<a class="headerlink" href="#firefox" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We&#8217;re hoping that the lack of Firefox support is going to be
temporary. For years, wed was supporting Firefox. Early on, Firefox
was even better supported than Chrome. However, the people responsible
for maintaining Selenium decided to stop supporting native events in
Firefox and forced developers to use synthetic events instead. The
problem is that Selenium&#8217;s support for synthetic events on Firefox is
unable to accurately reproduce what happens when a user is actually
interacting with a browser, <em>which is the entire point of using
Selenium in the first place</em>. The problem has been reported, at
length:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>In the <cite>selenium-developers</cite> group <a class="reference external" href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/selenium-developers/DKnG2lA-KxM/EMLiT87ykZYJ">here</a> and in following replies.</li>

</ul>
<p>It is taking forever for the problem to get resolved. In the meantime,
we have no resources to devote to solving the issue of synthetic event
support in Firefox and so Firefox support has been temporarily pulled.</p>

<h3>Edge<a class="headerlink" href="#edge" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>What&#8217;s the deal with Edge being at a lower level of support than IE
11? The problem is that whereas we can run test suites for IE 11, it
is not <em>yet</em> possible to do so for Edge. Microsoft has not yet
released a version of Edge which does support everything needed to run
our suite. (See <a class="reference external" href="https://dev.windows.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/status/webdriver/details/">this page</a>
for the technical details.) Therefore we cannot systematically test
wed with Edge and thus it is not as supported as IE 11. If you do find
a problem with Edge, report it and we&#8217;ll try to fix it.</p>

<p class="last">If you are using any version of OS X that hides
scroll bars by default, you probably want to modify your
OS X settings so that scroll bars are always
shown. Otherwise, there are situations where you won&#8217;t
know about contents being scrollable. If you need help
doing so, <a class="reference external" href="http://heresthethingblog.com/2013/02/25/mac-tip-missing-scroll-bars/">see this blog post</a>. Note
that wed will work either way, and you will be able to
scroll either way, but wed relies on the traditional
scroll bar behavior to indicate that something can be
scrolled. So if you do not make the change above, you can
end up in situations where something is scrollable
without having any visual indication that <em>it is</em>.</p>
</div>
<p>The test suite depends on native events to do its work, but support
for native events in OS X is spotty:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Chrome: it is possible to generate <em>some</em> native events.</li>
<li>Firefox reports that it does not support native events at all.</li>
<li>Safari does not support native events at all.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your best bet in OS X is to use Chrome because we can&#8217;t run the test
suite with Firefox or Safari.</p>

<h3>Safari<a class="headerlink" href="#safari" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Safari is a vexing case. Wed may or may not work on Safari. We
currently cannot run the automated test suite with Safari. Manual
testing is out of the question.</p>
<p>We would like to have wed be supported on recent versions of Safari to
the same extent it is supported on recent versions of Chrome. The tool
we use to test it is Selenium. For better or for worse this is the
go-to tool to do the kind of test wed needs. We&#8217;ve not seen evidence
of any collaboration between the Selenium project and Apple. Thus
testing support for Safari is deficient, and it is not something that
we here have the resources to fix.</p>
<p>If you desire that wed be actually tested on Safari and are in a
position to contribute substantial monetary or technical resources
towards this goal, you are welcome to contact us. In particular,
immediate problem we&#8217;ve run into when trying to test on Safari is this
<a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=4136">Selenium issue</a>. If you
want fix it, then this would bring us one step closer to being able to
test wed on Safari. And regarding the state of Selenium support for
Safari, take note this response from a Selenium project member:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Safari is not a priority, sorry. But your patches are welcome!</div></blockquote>
<p>Absent these patches, wed is unlikely to support Safari.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you feel the urge to write an email saying &#8220;You
should just...&#8221;, then please abstain because there is nothing &#8220;just&#8221;
about testing web applications.</p>

<div class="section" id="brief-explanation">
<h3>Brief Explanation<a class="headerlink" href="#brief-explanation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In brief, this occurs if the Relax NG schema uses a wildcard (so to
speak) that allows an unlimited number of possibilities for the name
of an element or of an attribute. (Or a set of possibilities that
cannot be expressed as a set of positive matches.)  Wed is capable to
validate such documents. However its capability to edit them is
currently limited. Wed will actually mark as <strong>read only</strong> elements
and attributes that are allowed only due to a wildcard. These may not
be modified in wed. The menu item that wed shows is a warning that the
schema allows for more than what wed is able to do. If this is a
problem for you, you should contact whoever provides you with
technical support to discuss the problem. You may direct them to read
the explanation that follows.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="long-technical-explanation">
<h3>Long Technical Explanation<a class="headerlink" href="#long-technical-explanation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A Relax NG schema normally constrains the set of possible valid
structures to a limited set. Take the following schema:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>start = element a { (element b { empty } | element c { empty })+ }
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If we have finished reading the start tag for <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">a</span></code>, then there are
only two possibilities: either a start tag for the element named <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">b</span></code>
or a start tag for the element named <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">c</span></code>. However, Relax NG allows
schemas that effectively say &#8220;any element is fine here&#8221;. For instance:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>start = element a { any+ }
any = element * { any* }
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">*</span></code> that appears after the second <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">element</span></code> tells the
validator that any element name is possible. With this schema, once
we&#8217;ve processed the start tag for element <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">a</span></code>, then it is possible
to encounter any element whatsoever. This is a problem for wed
because, in addition to validation, it provides <em>guided</em> editing.</p>
<p>For now, we&#8217;ve decided that wed will not support such patterns in
editing. Why? In our experience, these patterns are normally used to
provide opportunities to expand a schema. An excellent example is
DocBook, which has provisions for including XML structures encoded
according to the MathML or SVG schemas. From the standpoint of
validating the document it makes good sense to have the DocBook schema
declare that some elements will allow any element, provided that they
come from the MathML or SVG namespaces. There are scenarios where it
is not necessary to know anything about MathML or SVG. This is fine
insofar as validation is concerned.</p>
<p>However, when <em>editing</em> to add a MathML section to a DocBook document,
there&#8217;s a problem. Suppose a user wants to add a formula encoded with
MathML to a DocBook document, and user is using the default DocBook
schema. The only thing wed has to help the editing is &#8220;any element
from MathML is valid here&#8221;, because this is what the default schema
says. What are the consequences?</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>First, wed is unable to check that the MathML is in fact <a href="#id3"><span class="problematic" id="id4">*</span></a>valid</li>
</ul>
<p>MathML*. The DocBook schema does not contain any information regarding
what is valid MathML. It allows anything and everything, so long as it
is declared to be in the MathML namespace. It therefore allows
constructs that may not be valid MathML. (Note that wed is just
following what the <em>schema specifies</em>, no more, no less.)</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Second, wed would have to prompt the user for every element and</li>
</ul>
<p>attribute name. For every MathML element to be added, the user would
get a dialog box and have to enter an element&#8217;s name, because wed has
no finite set of options to choose from. Editing becomes a slog.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve estimated that it is not worth adding to wed any facilities to
support scenarios like the one just described. If someone wants to
edit DocBook documents that allow MathML, they should provide wed with
a DocBook schema that has been merged with the MathML schema so that
the final schema uses the actual elements specified by MathML rather
than say &#8220;anything from MathML is valid here&#8221;. This takes care of the
problems mentioned above.</p>
