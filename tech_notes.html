<h2>Build Information<a class="headerlink" href="#build-information" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Every time a build is performed, the building process stores
information about the build into a file which at run time is available
as a module at the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">lib/wed/build-info</span></tt> location relative to the
root of the build directory. This module contains two fields:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">desc</span></tt> is a description of the build. This string is created by
running <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">describe</span></tt> and adding to the result the string
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-unclean</span></tt> if the build was done with an unclean working tree.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">date</span></tt> is the date of the build. (To be precise, it is the date at
which the build <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">build-info</span></tt> module was generated.)</li>
</ul>
<p>This information was added to wed as of version 0.11.0. If you happen
to use wed&#8217;s development code that was produced after version 0.10.0
was released but before version 0.11.0 was released, then the version
number you&#8217;ll get in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">desc</span></tt> field will start with
&#8220;v0.10.0-x&#8221;. The additional &#8220;-x&#8221; is a special case to work around a
bug in gitflow.</p>

<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="first admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p class="last">As of version 0.10.0 there is a nasty bug in the
optimized bundle. You may still experiment with the
optimized version of wed if you want to do so, provided
that you don&#8217;t deploy it in production. The bug in
question is documented <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mangalam-research/wed/issues/8">here</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>It is possible to deploy wed using the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">build/standalone/</span></tt> file tree
but you will pay in execution time and bandwidth because the files in
this tree are not optimized.</p>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">build/standalone-optimized/</span></tt> file tree is optimized. This
optimization exists primarily for illustration purposes and for
testing wed, but it could be used for deployment too, as long as you
understand how it is constructed. The build file driving how <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">r.js</span></tt>
created the optimized tree is <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">requirejs.build.js</span></tt>. Here are the
major characteristics of this optimization:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>All of wed&#8217;s JavaScript is combined into one file. The only part of
wed excluded is the test mode used in testing, which is not meant to
be deployed anywhere.</li>
<li>All external libraries (jQuery, Bootstrap, etc.) are excluded from
the optimization.</li>
<li>The CSS files are not optimized with regards to space but not combined.</li>
</ul>
<p>This optimization is designed to provide a balance between performance
and flexibility. Greater performance could have been achieved by
incorporating into one file all of the external libraries. However,
such bundle would be unlikely to be trivially deployable on a
full-fledged web site in which wed would be embedded. Such site might
already be using jQuery and Bootstrap, perhaps different versions from
those used to build wed, etc. The optimization described above could
conceivably be used on this hypothetical server, provided that the
configuration is updated to look for the external libraries at the
right places.</p>
<p>Wed&#8217;s build process creates a configuration for the optimized bundle
at <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">build/standalone-optimized/requirejs-config.js</span></tt>. This
configuration allows an external custom mode to load individual
modules of wed, because it has mappings like these:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>"wed/log": "wed/wed",
"wed/oop": "wed/wed",
"wed/lib/simple_event_emitter": "wed/wed",
[...]</pre>
</div>
<p>which map each individual module forming wed to the single bundle file
created during the optimization process. If you base your own run time
RequireJS configuration on this file, it is possible for code external
to the bundle, for instance a custom mode, to load parts of wed in an
arbitrary order.</p>
<p>It is also possible to use a configuration file that does not have the
individual module mappings. In this scenario, it is <strong>not</strong> possible
for code external to wed to load parts of wed in an arbitrary
order. The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">wed.js</span></tt> file has to be loaded first, and then wed&#8217;s
modules become accessible. Note that this way of operating should work
for the vast majority of cases because the typical usage scenario for
wed is to first create a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">wed.Editor</span></tt> instance which dynamically
loads a mode. Since the mode is loaded after <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">wed.Editor</span></tt> is
created, it is guaranteed that by the time the mode runs, all of wed&#8217;s
modules are available.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="schema-and-structure-considerations">
<h2>Schema and Structure Considerations<a class="headerlink" href="#schema-and-structure-considerations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The following discussion covers schema design considerations if you
wish to use wed to enforce editing constraints. It is possible to rely
instead on user discipline to enforce constraints, just like one would
do if using a plain text editor to edit XML. If this is your case,
then you do not need to concern yourself with the following.</p>
<p>If you want constraints to be enforced <strong>by wed</strong>, then prioritize
using a data structure that accurately reflects your <strong>editing</strong>
concerns rather than your interchange concerns or your standard
conformance concerns. Here&#8217;s an example. Suppose that you use a schema
based on the TEI markup, and that for interchange purposes with
another system it makes sense to encode something like:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>&lt;p&gt;&lt;term&gt;&lt;foreign xml:lang="fr"&gt;Étranger&lt;/foreign&gt;&lt;/term&gt; is a foreign
term.&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
</div>
<p>However, you do not want to allow your users to insert text inside the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;term&gt;</span></tt> element but outside <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;foreign&gt;</span></tt> because that encoding is
meaningless in your project. Wed is not designed to easily enforce
this restriction. Wed will allow your users to create something
like:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>&lt;p&gt;&lt;term&gt;The term &lt;foreign xml:lang="fr"&gt;étranger&lt;/foreign&gt;
&lt;/term&gt;is a foreign term.&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
</div>
<p>The solution here is to represent the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;term&gt;&lt;foreign&gt;&lt;/foreign&gt;&lt;/term&gt;</span></tt> structure as one element, for
editing purposes. If it so happens that all instances of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;foreign&gt;</span></tt>
are always to be interpreted as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;term&gt;&lt;foreign&gt;&lt;/foreign&gt;&lt;/term&gt;</span></tt>
for interchange purposes, then you might as well make your editing
structure <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;foreign&gt;</span></tt> and convert it to the interchange structure
when you actually need to interchange. In other cases, you might want
to create your own element for editing, like <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;my:custom-element&gt;</span></tt>,
which is then created in the right context by the mode you create for
your project.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="remote-logging">
<span id="id1"></span><h2>Remote Logging<a class="headerlink" href="#remote-logging" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Wed uses log4javascript to log anything worth logging. By default, wed
does not log anything to a remote server; however, if the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ajaxlog</span></tt>
option is passed to wed, it will add an <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">AjaxAppender</span></tt> to the logger
and log messages using <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">XmlLayout</span></tt>. The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ajaxlog</span></tt> option is of the
form:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>ajaxlog: {
    url: "...",
    headers: { ... }
}</pre>
</div>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">url</span></tt> parameter is the URL where log4javascript will send the
log messages. The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">headers</span></tt> parameter specifies additional headers
to send. In particular this is useful when the receiver is an
installation requiring that some anti-CSRF token be set on HTTP
headers.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="saving">
<span id="id2"></span><h2>Saving<a class="headerlink" href="#saving" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Wed saves documents using Ajax queries to a server. Where wed saves is
determined by the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">save</span></tt> option. It is of the form:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>save: {
    path: "...",
    options: {
    }
}</pre>
</div>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">path</span></tt> parameter is the path to the module that implements the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Saver</span></tt> abstract class. The two choices for now are
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">wed/savers/ajax</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">wed/savers/localforage</span></tt>.</p>
<div class="section" id="ajax-saver">
<h3>Ajax Saver<a class="headerlink" href="#ajax-saver" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Ajax saver requires a server that understands the wire protocol
used by this saver. The configuration for it is as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>save: {
    path: "wed/savers/ajax",
    options: {
        url: "...",
        headers: { ... }
        autosave: ...,
        initial_etag: ...,
    }
}</pre>
</div>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">url</span></tt> option is required. It is the URL where wed will send the
Ajax queries for saving. The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">headers</span></tt> option is as described above
for logging. It is optional. The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">autosave</span></tt> option is a number of
seconds between autosaves. It is optional. Setting it to 0 will turn
off autosaving. Wed will autosave only if it detects that the document
has been changed since the last save. The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">initial_etag</span></tt> option is
the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ETag</span></tt> of the document being loaded. It is required.</p>
<p>Queries are sent as POST requests with the following parameters:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">command</span></tt>: the command wed is issuing.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">version</span></tt>: the version of wed issuing the command.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">data</span></tt>: The data associated with the command. This is always a string
serialization of the data tree.</li>
</ul>
<p>The possible commands are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">check</span></tt>: This is a mere version check.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">save</span></tt>: Sent when the user manually requests a save.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">autosave</span></tt>: Sent when an autosave occurs.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">recover</span></tt>: Sent when wed detects a fatal condition requiring
reloading the editor from scratch. The server must save the data
received and note that it was a recovery.</li>
</ul>
<p>The replies are sent as JSON-encoded data. Each reply is a single
object with a single field named <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">messages</span></tt> which is a list of
messages. Each message has a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">type</span></tt> field which determines its
meaning and what other fields may be present in the message. The
possible message types are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">version_too_old_error</span></tt> indicates that the version of wed trying to
access the server is too old.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">save_transient_error</span></tt> indicates that the save operation cannot
happen for some transient reason. The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">msg</span></tt> parameter on the
message should give a user-friendly message indicating what
the problem is and, to the extent possible, how to resolve it.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">save_fatal_error</span></tt> indicates that the save operation failed
fatally. This is used for cases where the user cannot reasonably do
anything to resolve the problem.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">locked_error</span></tt> indicates that the document the user wants to save
is locked.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">save_successful</span></tt> indicates that the save was successful.</li>
</ul>
<p>The protocol uses <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">If-Match</span></tt> to check that the document being saved
has not been edited by some other user. Therefore, it needs an
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ETag</span></tt> to be generated. It acquires its initial <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ETag</span></tt> from the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">save</span></tt> option described above. Subsequent successful save operations
must provide an <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ETag</span></tt> value representing the saved document.</p>
<p>The meaning of the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ETag</span></tt> value is generally ambiguous. See the
following documents for some discussions of the issue:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-whitehead-http-etag/">https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-whitehead-http-etag/</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-reschke-http-etag-on-write/">https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-reschke-http-etag-on-write/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The current code handles the lack of precision such that <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ETag</span></tt>
values returned on error conditions are ignored. Otherwise, the
following could happen:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Alice loads document, grabs initial <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ETag</span></tt>.</li>
<li>Bob loads same document, grabs initial <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ETag</span></tt>.</li>
<li>Bob saves new version, creates new <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ETag</span></tt>.</li>
<li>Alice tries to save with an <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">If-Match</span></tt> that has the old
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ETag</span></tt>. This fails and returns an <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ETag</span></tt> with the response.</li>
</ol>
<p>This last <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ETag</span></tt> would have to be the one that matches what is
<em>currently</em> stored in the server. Alice&#8217;s wed instance <strong>must not</strong>
use this <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ETag</span></tt> to update the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ETag</span></tt> it associates with its
document, otherwise a subsequent save will (erroneously) go through.</p>
<p>This may not correspond to how other systems use <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ETag</span></tt>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="localforage-saver">
<h3>Localforage Saver<a class="headerlink" href="#localforage-saver" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This saver uses <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mozilla/localForage">localForage</a> to store the data in the
browser. It is configured as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>save: {
    path: "wed/savers/localforage",
    options: {
        name: "..."
    }
}</pre>
</div>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">name</span></tt> parameter is the name to use for saving the document in

<div class="section" id="creating-a-mode">
<h1>Creating a Mode<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-a-mode" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>We recommend creating new modes by inheriting from the generic
mode. The first thing you must do is set the metadata on the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">_wed_options</span></tt> object because wed will refuse to load your mode if
these are not set:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">this</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">_wed_options</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">metadata</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>

<span class="p">};</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Modes may set other options on the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">_wed_options</span></tt> property:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">label_levels</span></tt>: an object with two fields:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">max</span></tt>: determines the maximum level of
<em class="xref std std-ref">label visibility</em>,</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">initial</span></tt> determines the initial level of label visibility; must
be <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">1</span> <span class="pre">&lt;=</span> <span class="pre">initial</span> <span class="pre">&lt;=</span> <span class="pre">max</span></tt>. (Level 0 exists. It is just not valid
to start at that level.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">attributes</span></tt>: determines the level of <em>direct</em> attribute editing
support provided by wed. By &#8220;direct editing&#8221; we mean allowing the
user to change the value of attributes directly, as attributes. No
matter what level is selected, wed itself or its modes are <em>always</em>
free to modify attributes behind the scenes.</p>
<p>The levels are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&quot;hide&quot;</span></tt>: wed won&#8217;t show attributes and won&#8217;t allow editing
them directly.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&quot;show&quot;</span></tt>: wed will show attributes but won&#8217;t allow editing
them directly.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&quot;edit&quot;</span></tt>: wed will show and allow editing attributes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are examples to illustrate some of the differences and what
they mean concretely. Suppose a project based on TEI that uses
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ptr</span></tt> to link to other elements in the document. This <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ptr</span></tt>
element uses the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&#64;target</span></tt> attribute to point to the desired
element. A mode using <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&quot;hide&quot;</span></tt> would not allow the user to see
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&#64;target</span></tt> or to manually enter a target in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&#64;target</span></tt>. However,
it could present a menu item saying &#8220;Create hyperlink to other
element&#8221; and provide a list of elements the user may link to to
choose from. When the user selects an element, the mode would create
a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ptr</span></tt> element with an appropriate <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&#64;target</span></tt> value. If needed,
it would also create a proper <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&#64;id</span></tt> on the element to which the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&#64;target</span></tt> refers. The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&#64;id</span></tt> attribute, just like <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&#64;target</span></tt>
would not be editable by the user directly or visible to the user.</p>
<p>Suppose a similar project but a less sophisticated mode that does
not assist with hyperlinking. Here, the mode set the option to
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&quot;edit&quot;</span></tt> for the attributes. In this setup, the user would have to
create their <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ptr</span></tt> element and add themselves a proper value for
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&#64;target</span></tt> through the attribute editing functions. They would also
be responsible for putting a proper <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&#64;id</span></tt> on the element to which
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&#64;target</span></tt> refers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="testing">
<h1>Testing<a class="headerlink" href="#testing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Note that due to the asynchronous nature of the JavaScript environments
used to run the tests, if the test suites are run on a system
experiencing heavy load or if the OS has to swap a lot of memory from
the hard disk, they may fail some or all tests. We&#8217;ve witnessed this
happen, for instance, due to RequireJS timing out on a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">require()</span></tt>
call because the OS was busy loading things into memory from
swap. The solution is to run the test suites again.</p>
<p>Another issue with running the tests is that wed uses <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">setTimeout</span></tt>
to do the validation work in a parallel fashion. (This actually
simulates parallelism.) Now, browsers clamp timeouts to at most once a
second for tests that are in background tabs (i.e. tabs whose content
is not currently visible). Some tests want the first validation to be
finished before starting. The upshot is that if the test tab is pushed
to the background some tests will fail due to timeouts. The solution
for now is don&#8217;t push the tab in which tests are run to the
background. Web workers would solve this problem but would create
other complications so it is unclear whether they are a viable
solution.</p>
<p>Tests are of three types:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Not browser-dependent and therefore may be run outside a browser. We
run these in Node.js.</li>
<li>In-browser tests run <em>in</em> the browser.</li>
<li>Selenium-based tests which run <em>outside</em> the browser but use selenium
to control a browser.</li>

installed and available on your <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">PYTHONPATH</span></tt>.</p>
<p>It is very likely that you&#8217;ll want to override some of the values in
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mangalam-research/wed/blob/master/config/selenium_config.py">config/selenium_config.py</a> by creating
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">local_config/selenium_config.py</span></tt> that loads the default file but
override or adds some values. For instance:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c"># If used, must appear before the default file is loaded. The</span>
<span class="c"># default is to not log anything.</span>
<span class="n">LOGS</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">True</span>

<span class="c"># Load the default file</span>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>To run the Selenium-based tests, you can run either
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">server.js</span></tt> <em>or</em> an nginx-based server. The latter option is
recommended if you run your browser on a provisioning service like
SauceLabs <em>and</em> you want to maximize performance. Running
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">server.js</span></tt> has been explained above. To run nginx, just issue:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>$ misc/start_nginx</pre>
</div>
<p>This will launch an nginx server listening on localhost:8888. It will
handle all the requests to static resources itself, but will forward
all Ajax stuff to an instance of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">server.js</span></tt> (which is started by
the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">start_nginx</span></tt> script to listen on localhost:9999). This server
puts all of the things that would go in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/var/</span></tt> if it was started by
the OS in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">var/</span></tt> directory that sits at the top of the code
tree. Look there for logs. This nginx instance uses the configuration
built at <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">build/config/nginx.conf</span></tt> from
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">config/nginx.conf</span></tt>.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="first admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p class="last">Remember that if you want to override the configuration,
the proper way to do it is to copy the configuration file
into <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">local_config/</span></tt> and edit it there.</p>
</div>
<p>Run <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">make</span></tt> again after you have made modifications. The only
processing done on nginx&#8217;s file is to replace instances of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&#64;PWD&#64;</span></tt>
with the top of the code tree.</p>
<p>Finally, to run the suite issue:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>$ make selenium-test TEST_BROWSER=&lt;platform&gt;,&lt;browser&gt;,&lt;version&gt;</pre>
</div>
<p>To run the suite while using the SauceLab servers, run:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>$ make SELENIUM_SAUCELABS=1 selenium-test TEST_BROWSER=...</pre>
</div>
<p>Behind the scenes, this will launch behave. See the makefile
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mangalam-research/wed/blob/master/build.mk">build.mk</a> for information about how behave is run.</p>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">TEST_BROWSER</span></tt> variable determines which browser will run the
test. You may omit any of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">platform</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">browser</span></tt> or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">versions</span></tt> so
long as the parts that are specified are enough to match a <strong>single</strong>
configuration defined in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mangalam-research/wed/blob/master/config/selenium_config.py">config/selenium_config.py</a>. See the
list of configurations there to see what has been configured. If you
want something different from the list there, you&#8217;ll have to configure
it in the copy you made into <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">local_config</span></tt>.</p>
<p>The environment variable <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">BEHAVE_WAIT_BETWEEN_STEPS</span></tt> can be set to a
numerical value in seconds to get behave to stop between steps. It
makes the Selenium test unfold more slowly. The environment variable
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SELENIUM_QUIT</span></tt> can be set to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">never</span></tt> to prevent Selenium from
quitting the browser after the suite is run. It can be set to
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">on-success</span></tt> so that the Selenium quits only if the suite is
successful.</p>

for the standard JavaScript type of events onto any GUI element that
wed is responsible for managing. They must use the appropriate custom
wed events. This ensures proper ordering of processing. Here is the
list of JavaScript events for which custom events have been defined;
the order the events are listed corresponds to the order they are
processed</p>
<ul class="simple">

<p>Modes that define elements in the GUI tree that want to have their own

<h2>Support for GUI Controls Outside Wed<a class="headerlink" href="#support-for-gui-controls-outside-wed" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>By default, wed does not provide any kind of drop down menus or
toolbar to perform actions like undo/redo, etc. The application that
embeds wed into it, however, might need such tools. Now, the problem
is that as far as wed is concerned, these items are not part of the
editing pane and thus, manipulating them should cause a blurring of
the editor. This is undesirable because:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>It means that a GUI control that fires a transformation would fire
it when the caret is not defined (because of the blur). This causes
wed to raise an exception.</li>
<li>Even if the previous point could somehow be worked around because
wed keeps enough state to know where the caret was before the blur
happened, the user would still <strong>see</strong> the focus leave the editor
pane.</li>
</ul>
<p>Consequently, such elements must be made known to wed so that it does
not consider clicks in them to cause a loss of
focus. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Editor.excludeFromBlur</span></tt> is the method to use to register
these elements with wed.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">

<h2>IM Support<a class="headerlink" href="#im-support" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As usual, the browsers and various web standards make a mess of what
ought to be simple. On both Firefox 23 and Chrome 29, entering text
using IBus does not generate <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">keypress</span></tt> events. The only events
available are <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">keydown</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">keyup</span></tt>. Firefox 23 generates a single
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">keyup</span></tt> event at the end of composition, Chrome 29 generates a bunch
of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">keyup</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">keydown</span></tt> events while the character is being
composed. These events are mostly useless because their parameters are
set to values that do not indicate what the user is actually
typing. The browsers also fire <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">input</span></tt> and
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">composition{start,update,end}</span></tt> events, which are also nearly
useless. The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">input</span></tt> event does not state what was done to the
data. The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">composition{start,update,end}</span></tt> events indicate that
composition happened. In theory the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">data</span></tt> parameter should hold the
data being changed, but on Chrome 29 the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">compositionend</span></tt> event has
a blank <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">data</span></tt> field when entering the Chinese character for wo3
(&#8220;I&#8221;).</p>
<p>There&#8217;s an additional complication in that these events can happen
when the user wants to <strong>edit</strong> a composed character rather than
delete or add text. Suppose that we are editing the string &#8220;livré&#8221; to
read &#8220;livre&#8221;. The way to do it without composition is in two
operations: delete the &#8220;é&#8221; and insert &#8220;e&#8221; (or in the reverse order).
However, with composition a character can be transformed into another character
by one atomic change on the data. A composition method could make the
change by replacing &#8220;é&#8221; with &#8220;e&#8221; as one operation, without there being
a deletion followed by an insertion. The character itself is
transformed.</p>
<p>What wed currently does is capture all keydown and keypress events
that are capturable to edit the data tree and <strong>cancel</strong> the default
behavior. (Then the GUI tree is updated from the data tree and it
looks like text input happened.) So these won&#8217;t generate input
events. When an input event <strong>is</strong> detected, compare all text nodes of
the element on which the event triggered (a GUI node) with those of
its corresponding data element. Update data nodes as needed.</p>

specifically to this element.</dd>
<dt><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">_phantom</span> <span class="pre">_decoration_text</span></tt>:</dt>
<dd>All elements that are text added for purely decorative purposes. The
difference between these elements and those which are <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">_phantom</span>
<span class="pre">_text</span></tt> is that the latter represents some contents whereas the
former is purely decorating the data. For instance if an <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;img&gt;</span></tt>
element which points to the image of a cow is represented on screen
by the word &#8220;cow&#8221; then this text should be <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">_phantom</span> <span class="pre">_text</span></tt>. On
the other hand if a period is added after numbers in a list so that
they look nice on screen, these periods should be <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">_phantom</span>
<span class="pre">_decoration_text</span></tt> elements.</dd>
<dt><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__start_label</span></tt>:</dt>

<dt><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">_&lt;id&gt;_label</span></tt>:</dt>
<dd>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;id&gt;</span></tt> part is the name of an element. This class marks a
label as belonging to an <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;id&gt;</span></tt> element. For instance, a label for
a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">p</span></tt> element will have the class <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">_p_label</span></tt>. The full set of
classes for such a label which happens to mark the start of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">p</span></tt>
will be <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">_gui</span> <span class="pre">_phantom</span> <span class="pre">__start_label</span> <span class="pre">_p_label</span></tt>.</dd>
<dt><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">_start_wrapper</span></tt>:</dt>
<dd>Marks an element which wraps the editable content of an

<h1>Browser Issues<a class="headerlink" href="#browser-issues" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The sad fact is that browsers are limited in functionality, buggy, or
incompatible with each other. This section documents such issues.</p>
<div class="section" id="cut-paste-copy">
<h2>Cut, Paste, Copy<a class="headerlink" href="#cut-paste-copy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Copying and pasting don&#8217;t present any special difficulties. However,
cutting is problematic, because:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Browsers don&#8217;t allow JavaScript to initiate cuts. So it is not
possible to intercept a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cut</span></tt> event and then cause the browser to
cut by using a <em>different</em> event.</li>
<li>A cut modifies the DOM directly. This is a problem because wed
wants modifications to go through <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">TreeUpdater</span></tt> objects. An
earlier version of wed was letting <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cut</span></tt> events go through and
updated the data tree but this caused the GUI tree to become
stale. (An additional complication is that there is no undoing.)</li>
</ol>
<p>It is possible to listen to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cut</span></tt> events and let them go through or
veto them, but this is about the maximum level of control that can be
achieved cross-browser.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="contenteditable">
<h2>Contenteditable<a class="headerlink" href="#contenteditable" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="incompatibilities">
<h3>Incompatibilities<a class="headerlink" href="#incompatibilities" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>One area of incompatibility is the implementation of contenteditable
across browsers. Even a single browser can behave inconsistently
depending on how the DOM tree is structured. (In Firefox 20, the
presence or absence of white-space text nodes sometimes changes the
way BACKSPACE is handled when the caret is at the start of a
contenteditable element.)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="successive-elements-and-the-caret">
<h3>Successive Elements and the Caret<a class="headerlink" href="#successive-elements-and-the-caret" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Suppose the structure:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>&lt;p contenteditable="true"&gt;foo &lt;button contenteditable="false"&gt;A&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;button contenteditable="false"&gt;B&lt;/button&gt; bar&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
</div>
<p>If you place the caret just before the space before &#8220;bar&#8221; and hit the
left arrow to move it back between buttons A and B, various browsers
will handle it differently. At any rate, in both Chrome 26 and Firefox
20, there will <strong>not</strong> be a caret <strong>between</strong> A and B. The caret may
disappear or be moved somewhere else. The same result occurs if you place the
caret after the space after <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">foo</span></tt> and hit the right arrow.</p>
<p>Setting the caret programmatically does not work either but in general
results in the caret disappearing.  Browsers differ a little bit. In
Chrome 26, it seems that even though the caret becomes invisible, it
still exists between the two elements. (It is possible to delete
either button.) In Firefox 20, the caret becomes
non-existent (editing is not possible).</p>
<p>So to allow editing between successive elements, wed has to create a
placeholder to allow the user to put their caret between elements.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="synthetic-keyboard-events">
<h2>Synthetic Keyboard Events<a class="headerlink" href="#synthetic-keyboard-events" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In Firefox 20, it seems impossible to get the browser to handle a
synthetic keyboard event exactly as if the user had typed it. The
event can be created and dispatched, and it will trigger event
handlers. However, sending a series of &#8220;keydown&#8221;, &#8220;keypress&#8221;, &#8220;keyup&#8221;
events for the letter &#8220;a&#8221; while the caret is in a contenteditable
region won&#8217;t result in the letter &#8220;a&#8221; being added to the element being
edited.</p>
<p>It is possible to use plugins like <a class="reference external" href="http://bililite.com/blog/2011/01/23/improved-sendkeys/">sendkeys</a> to simulate key presses
that actually modify the contents of editable elements. However, when
it comes to simulating key presses in contenteditable elements, the
simulation is very imperfect. Cursory testing sending BACKSPACE using
sendkeys and BACKSPACE using the keyboard shows inconsistent behavior.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="vetoing-mutations">
<h2>Vetoing Mutations<a class="headerlink" href="#vetoing-mutations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>It might seem that using MutationObserver to check on a DOM tree, one
would be able to veto a user-initiated change inside contenteditable
elements. In practice, a single keyboard key (like BACKSPACE) hit
might result in 5-6 mutations of the DOM tree, and there is no simple
way to know that these 5-6 mutations were all initiated by a single
key.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="historical-notes">
<h1>Historical Notes<a class="headerlink" href="#historical-notes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Initially wed was designed with the idea that <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">contenteditable</span></tt>
would take care of caret management, selection management, text entry,
etc. Consequently, wed would let the browser drive the management of
these things and query the browser to know where the caret was,
whether there was a selection, etc. However, experience soon proved
that the browsers did not handle these functions in a way that was
appropriate for wed. So wed had to take over the management of some of
these functions. Since there was always some hope that at least <em>some</em>
of these functions could <em>still</em> be delegated to the browser, these
changes happened incrementally, changing only as much as needed to get
the desired result. Some of these changes made earlier code obsolete
but this was not discovered immediately. So wed evolved form this approach:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>The browser is the authority on the caret position, the selection,
and related things. Wed queries the browser as needed.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>To this approach:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Wed is the authority on the caret position, the selection, and
related things. Wed updates the browser&#8217;s idea of such things as
needed.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The incremental nature of the changes made it so that overtime code
that operated under the first approach was found right next to code
that operated under the second approach. Version 0.17.0 cleaned up a
good deal of the old code (first approach) that was made obsolete by
the incremental changes, but some obsolete code may still remain.</p>
