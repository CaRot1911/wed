Introduction
============

Wed is a web-based editor that assists users in editing XML documents
according to their own Relax NG schema. It runs in a web browser. It
is alpha software. We aim to make it extensible, but the API is likely
to change until we hit version 1.0.0.

Our extensive documentation can be `read here
<http://mangalam-research.github.io/wed/>`_.
