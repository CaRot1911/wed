/**
 * Convert a "pattern object" to a string that can be shown to the user. This
 * function is meant to be used for "complex" name patterns that we may get from
 * salve. Note that a "pattern object" is the result of calling ``toObject()``
 * on the pattern. The goal of this function is to convert the pattern object to
 * a string that would be intepretable by the end user.
 *
 * An explanation about how this handles namespaces and wildcard patterns is in
 * order. In a Relax NG schema the name pattern ``*`` in the compact notation is
 * equivalent to ``<anyName/>`` in the expanded notation. And ``foo:*`` is
 * equivalent to ``<nsName ns="uri_of_foo">`` where ``uri_of_foo`` is the URI
 * that has been assocated with ``foo`` in the compact schema. It would be nice
 * if the function here could reuse this notation, but we cannot. Consider the
 * case where an Relax NG schema in the compact notation wants to declare a name
 * pattern which means "any name in the default namespace". In XML we express a
 * name in the default namespace currently in effect by simply not prefixing it
 * with a namespace name: whereas ``foo:bar`` is the ``bar`` element in the
 * ``foo`` namespace, ``bar`` is the ``bar`` element in the default
 * namespace. The pattern "any element in namespace foo" is represented with
 * ``foo:*``, however we cannot use ``*`` to mean "any element in the default
 * namespace", because ``*`` means "any name in any namespace whatsoever". The
 * compact notation forces the author of the schema to use a prefix for the
 * default namespace. And because of this, ``*`` means unambiguously "any
 * element in any namespace".
 *
 * So the ``*`` in the Relax NG schema becomes ``*:*`` here. "Any element in the
 * default namespace" is represented by ``*``. Thus ``foo:*`` and ``*`` can
 * stand in the same relation to one another as ``foo:bar`` and ``bar``.
 *
 * @param obj The "pattern object" to convert.
 * @param resolver The resolver to use to convert URIs to prefixes.
 * @returns The string representing the pattern.
