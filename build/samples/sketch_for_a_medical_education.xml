Its intricacy also requires the aid of the best Professors; and that the Pupil himself practice frequent dissections to attain this most necessary part of a Medical Education. Without the know<div class="lb _real" data-wed-rend="hidden" data-wed-type="hyphenInWord"></div>ledge of Anatomy, it is impossible either
<div class="pb _real" data-wed-n="2" data-wed-facs="7" data-wed-rend="none"></div>to discover the seat, nature, or cure, of Diseases. In Surgery no operation can be performed with safety or with much probability of success to the Patient. From dissections he likewise learns the nature of many hidden Disorders, and when similar symptoms occur to know the Disease under which the Patient la<div class="lb _real" data-wed-rend="hidden" data-wed-type="hyphenInWord"></div>bours. It also enables, the Physician or Surgeon when called upon by a Court of Justice, to determine with certainty whether Death has been occasioned from a natural cause, or from violence; hence he becomes the means of acquitting the innocent, and of condemning the guilty; but if ignorant of Anatomy, perhaps the contrary.</div><div class="p _real">CHEMISTRY is an other necessary part of a Medical Education, as with<div class="lb _real" data-wed-rend="hidden" data-wed-type="hyphenInWord"></div>out a knowledge of it we must ever be ig<div class="lb _real" data-wed-rend="hidden" data-wed-type="hyphenInWord"></div>norant of the various chemical Processes that are constantly going on in the Ani<div class="lb _real" data-wed-rend="hidden" data-wed-type="hyphenInWord"></div>mal oeconomy upon whom depends health or disease, and from a true knowledge of whom, we are greatly instucted how to preserve the first, and to cure the latter also the Physician is liable to give Pre<div class="lb _real" data-wed-rend="hidden" data-wed-type="hyphenInWord"></div>scriptions that cannot be compounded or

<div class="pb _real" data-wed-n="4" data-wed-facs="9" data-wed-rend="none"></div>the study of the Materia-Medica, there being frequently an analogy in the vir<div class="lb _real" data-wed-rend="hidden" data-wed-type="hyphenInWord"></div>tues of bodies of the same Genus.</div><div class="p _real">Lectures on the THEORY of ME<div class="lb _real" data-wed-rend="hidden" data-wed-type="hyphenInWord"></div>DICINE, may now be studied.
