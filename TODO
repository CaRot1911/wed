Caret Management
----------------

* _seekCaret needs a 400 ms timeout on IE, which is not small. If we
   can, we should drop _seekCaret and determine caret position
   ourselves without relying on the browsers default mechanisms. This
   would probably also mean completely dropping contenteditable.

* Generally refactor selection management.

* Caret management right now is a complicated affair. Wed should try
  to follow the blur and focus events so that whenever the caret moves
  out of the editing area, its location is stored and when the user
  moves back to the editing area, the location is restored. Right now,
  push/popSelection are used to prevent the caret to be lost when GUI
  elements that overlay the editing area are displayed but we should
  be able to get rid of this.

Other
-----

* Investigate web workers to replace timeouts as the main parallelism
  mechanism for running validation in the background.

* Dump XSLT altogether in favor of something faster? Loading saxon to
  process XSLT 2.0 has a non-negligible cost.

Other Bits of the Project
=========================

* Dump the perl solution to generating the local HTML files.

* Generate the local HTML somewhere else than in the root.
