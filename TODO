Caret Management
----------------

* _raw_caret can probably be eliminated.

* We should not ever have to read the DOM selection to check its
   status. (That is, we should be able to check the selection by
   looking at _sel_anchor and _sel_focus and not have to query the
   DOM.)

TreeUpdater
-----------

* Currently, TreeUpdater is designed so that the number of primitives
  is minimal. This has for effect that setTextNodeValue is used for
  inserting and deleting text. setTextNodeValue uses ``node.data =``
  to set the text, which is slower than using ``deleteData`` or
  ``insertData``. We should explore expanding the primitives so that
  these better performing methods can be used instead of doing
  ``node.data =``.

Saving Protocol
---------------

* The procotol could be redesigned to use HTTP error codes for error
   conditions.

Other
-----

* Investigate web workers to replace timeouts as the main parallelism
  mechanism for running validation in the background.

* Dump XSLT altogether in favor of something faster? Loading saxon to
  process XSLT 2.0 has a non-negligible cost.

Other Bits of the Project
=========================

* Dump the perl solution to generating the local HTML files.

* Generate the local HTML somewhere else than in the root.
