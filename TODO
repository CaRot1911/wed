Caret Management
================

* Generally refactor the caret and selection management.

* Caret management right now is a complicated affair. Wed should try
  to follow the blur and focus events so that whenever the caret moves
  out of the editing area, its location is stored and when the user
  moves back to the editing area, the location is restored. Right now,
  push/popSelection are used to prevent the caret to be lost when GUI
  elements that overlay the editing area are displayed but we should
  be able to get rid of this.

* Have real caret objects rather than the Array nonsense currently in
  effect.

=====

* Investigate web workers to replace timeouts as the main parallelism
  mechanism for running validation in the background.

* Dump XSLT altogether in favor of something faster? Loading saxon to
  process XSLT 2.0 has a non-negligible cost.
