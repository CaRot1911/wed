Caret Management
----------------

* _raw_caret can probably be eliminated.

* We should not ever have to read the DOM selection to check its status.

Other
-----

* Investigate web workers to replace timeouts as the main parallelism
  mechanism for running validation in the background.

* Dump XSLT altogether in favor of something faster? Loading saxon to
  process XSLT 2.0 has a non-negligible cost.

Other Bits of the Project
=========================

* Dump the perl solution to generating the local HTML files.

* Generate the local HTML somewhere else than in the root.
