      path:
        description: The path to the mode. Historically, wed has accepted the
          use of a shortened path here. So putting ``x`` would try to load the
          modules ``x``, ``wed/modes/x/x``, ``wed/modes/x/x-mode``,
          ``wed/modes/x/x_mode``. It is not recommended to do this anymore but
          to instead put a module name that the module loader can use
          immediately and irrespective of context.
